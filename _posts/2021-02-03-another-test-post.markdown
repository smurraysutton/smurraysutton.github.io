But daddy rules too

It's been really nice picking up Jekyll again after half-looking at it a while ago.
It wasn't nearly as confusing as I expected it to be and weirdly things just clicked in a way I wasn't expecting. Having finally been able to stop worrying about whether the dependencies were all in order and whether I needed several possible upgrades, I've actually pulled something together that looks like a very basic website.

I had a few ulterior motives:
1. To reaquaint myself with the coal-face of a job that I've become a bit distant from.
2. Explore the technical side of accessibility issues that I've been grappling with.
3. Just get some of my random thoughts into some sort of written form.

Jekyll and github pages have the appeal of being relatively simple to work with, especially as I'm really just interested in posting text and maybe the odd image.
