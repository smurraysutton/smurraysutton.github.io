According to this podcast [ref] from Talking Politics, one thing that set Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher apart was their approach to systems. Thatcher could deal with messiness, whereas Blair always tried to make everything work together.

I was reflecting on this and it occurred to me that in this instance, maybe Thatcher was right. If I was to characterise my approach, it's probably more like the labour prime minister than the Tory. All of my work and all of my critiques of organisations that don't work do often boil down to them not functioning properly as a system. I'm always chasing some perfectly organised system where the parts fit together more or less neatly and we have consensus on the way of doing things.

In a way I guess it's natural that a socialist would think that way; many conceptions of socialism revolve around a strong government organising the economy and other aspects of society to work together better for the benefit of all. So maybe Blair's viewpoint is an extension of that. Similiarly, it fits with the conservative viewpoint to view society more as a set of independent bodies that can't work together and that's just how it is.

However I think there's something to be learned from both these conceptions. We should push to make things work together better. To put together common rules to work from and clear governance where that's possible. But the chaotic nature of large systems made up of large numbers of people make me feel that it's not realistic to expect to bring absolutely everything together.

Often, as we strive to do the work to create consensus, some event is occurring that will sap our ability to forge that consensus. People leave, taking their share of the consensus with them. People arrive, with new ideas to add to the mix. Many people struggle to communicate their ideas clearly, so time is lost deciphering, the wrong thing is pursued, using up time needed. 

This doesn't necessarily meant these things have to compete. What it probably means is that we form forgiving means of communicating and operating. We realise chaos is the norm. But we start by assuming that behind that most people's motivations are sincere and aim for the good.

If we can really truely communicate in a forgiving way, then we can fill in the gaps where they occur. We cannot eliminate chaos - but we can become better at moving with it, giving time and space for clarity to show. Another word for this would probably be trust.
