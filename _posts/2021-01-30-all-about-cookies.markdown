I’ve been struggling through the vagueries of the updated cookie laws lately. It brought home how much we rely on analytics to do portions of our jobs these days. Although in local government we aren’t doing the most sophisticated analysis, the data we get does let us know simple truths about our website. It keeps us honest about what the real uses of our site are and helps to focus our efforts. This in turn can save money that is given to us by tax payers.

I can understand and sympathise with the efforts around cookie control. In many respects we are all reaping the rewards of the way that google, facebook and others have treated people’s private information. In the paranoia that has resulted, all attempts to monitor or observe online actions are treated, rightly, with suspicion. But that has led to a sledgehammer piece of legislation that compromises even [the most basic analytic setup](http://www.google.com/analytics). Ultimately all this was supposed to protect us from large adware companies from creating secret profiles of our digital behaviour. But it seems unlikely that will actually happen, as they have the talent and the technology to create these profiles from other sources.

For your humble civil servant, who just wants to know if anyone’s actually looked at the page about recycling plasterboard yet, it’s frustrating to say the least.

## What's left

Without analytics, we are left to consider how else we might work out whether a particular piece of content has been of any use or not.

User testing? absolutely; but with our ever more limited resources, how can we hope to inform our picture of the whole website? How on earth would we ever have a large enough, properly diverse sample size of testers to work out if the problems we’ve seen with 4-5 people today affect all 50-60,000 people who might be using that part of the website this week?

Surveys? same issue. You’d be lucky to canvas 2-300 people.

Of course we can monitor our outputs - how many people complete form x. How many phone calls did we receive last week?

Ultimately all these things go hand in hand. Our picture of analytics helps to inform the user testing that we do, the surveys, and vice-versa.
